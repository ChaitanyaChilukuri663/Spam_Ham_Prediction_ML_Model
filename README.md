# Spam_Ham_Prediction_ML_Model


This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning model developed to predict whether a message is spam or ham (non-spam). The model is trained on a dataset of labeled messages and utilizes natural language processing techniques to make predictions.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a spam-ham classification model that can accurately differentiate between spam and non-spam messages. By using this model, we can help identify and filter out unwanted spam messages, thereby improving user experience and communication efficiency.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a labeled dataset that includes text messages labeled as either "spam" or "ham." The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size, but you can find it from various sources online or create your own labeled dataset.

## Requirements

To run the code in the Jupyter notebook, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`. The versions specified in the requirements.txt file should be followed for compatibility.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   git clone https://github.com/ChaitanyaChilukuri663/Spam_Ham_Prediction_ML_Model.git


2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the Requirements section.

3. Obtain the labeled dataset and place it in the `/data` directory. The notebook assumes that the data file is named `spam.csv`.

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the cloned repository.

5. Open the `SMS Spam Detection.ipynb` notebook.

6. Follow the code in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model Development

The model uses various text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, removing stopwords, and stemming. It then employs a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, etc.) for classification.

## Results

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The notebook provides visualizations and insights into the model's effectiveness.

## Conclusion

The developed spam-ham classification model demonstrates promising results in identifying spam messages accurately. However, the performance can further be improved with the exploration of advanced NLP techniques, feature engineering, or trying out different classification algorithms.
